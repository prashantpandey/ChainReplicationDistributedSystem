/* 
 Client pseudo code

 General Data-Structures:
	enum Outcome { Processed, InconsistentWithHistory, InsufficientFunds }
	class Reply {
		string reqId;
		Outcome outcome;
		float bal;
	}
	
	enum Operation { GetBalance, Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer }

	class Request {
		string reqId,
		string bankId;
		string accountNum;
		float amount;
		string destBankId;
		string destAccountNum;
	}

	List reqList { reqId, Reply } 			// to maintain the history of requests
	Map bankServer { bankId, head, tail }		// map between bank and its servers	
		
 Events:
	- Failure: The client receives a response from the master that the head has failed.
		Update the  new head for corresponding bank.
		Check to see if there is any pending request. If yes, resend the request depending upon the config file flag. 
	- Receive: The client receives a response from the tail, it could be a success or failure.
		Update the corresponding request in the reqList.

 Functions:
	- update: 
		- deposit: 
			args:	reqId, accountNum, bankId, amount
			return: {reqId, Outcome, bal}
		- withdraw: 
			args: reqId, accountNum, bankId, amount
			return: {reqId, Outcome, bal}
		- transfer: 
			args: reqId, accountNum, bankId, amount, destAccountNum, destBankId
			return: {reqId, Outcome, bal}
			This function will have a different signature, instead of passing one bank as in the above two cases, we have to pass two banks here.

 	- Query:
		- getBalance:
	
	- checkTimeout:
			probes the list of requests to find out which request has not been catered yet.
			resend that request if the number of retries is smaller than the max retries possible and updates the number of retries.
			Rightnow we assume that the updateHist operations are not idempotent. Later (if time permits) we will implement more complex logic to support idempotent updates.
