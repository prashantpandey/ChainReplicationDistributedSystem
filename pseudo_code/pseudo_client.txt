/* 
 Client pseudo code

 General Data-Structures:
	enum Outcome { Processed, InconsistentWithHistory, InsufficientFunds }
	class Reply {
		string reqId;
		Outcome outcome;
		float bal;
	}
	
	enum Operation { GetBalance, Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer }

	class Request {
		string reqId,
		string bankId;
		string accountNum;
		float amount;
		string destBankId;
		string destAccountNum;
	}

	List reqList { reqId, Reply } 			// to maintain the history of requests
	Map bankServer { bankId, head, tail }		// map between bank and its servers	
		
 Events:
	- Failure: 
		- The client receives a response from the master that the head has failed.
		- Update the new head for corresponding bank.
		- Check to see if there is any pending request. 
		  If yes, resend the request depending upon the config file flag.

	- Receive: 
		- The client receives a response from the tail, it could be a success or failure.
		- Update the corresponding request in the reqList.

 Functions:
	- update: 
		- deposit: 
			args:	reqId, accountNum, bankId, amount
			return: reply:{reqId, Outcome, bal}
		- withdraw: 
			args: reqId, accountNum, bankId, amount
			return: reply:{reqId, Outcome, bal}
		- transfer: 
			args: reqId, accountNum, bankId, amount, destAccountNum, destBankId
			return: reply:{reqId, Outcome, bal}
			- This function will have a different signature, instead of passing one bank as in the above two cases, we have to pass two banks here.

 	- Query:
		- getBalance:
	
	- checkTimeout:
		- probes the reqList to find out which request has not been catered yet.
		- send that request if the number of retries is smaller than the max retries possible and updates the number of retries.
		- In case of update opeation, the client will query the tail if the reqId is present in its history. If yes, then it won't resend otherwise it will resend the request.
