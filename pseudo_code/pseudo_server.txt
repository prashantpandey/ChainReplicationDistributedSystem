 		Operation;
		Outcome outcome;

															// but are not received by the tail

	enum serverType { Head, Internal, Tail }

 Events:
	- receive 		// event to recieve the requests from the clients.
					// The requests can have four kind of operations.
					// Update request will be sent to the head server. Head will send sync message to next server in the chain.
					// Query request will be sent to the tail server. The tail will send the reply back to the client.
					// assign a unique sequence number to each received request.
		args:	Operation, Request

	- failure		// event to handle the failure of any adjecent server in the chain
					// this will just update the current value of the successor/predecessor/type
					// if the received server relation is predecessor
					// it will also send the master the sequence number of the last request it received
					// If the received server relation is successor, then send all the updates greater than the received seqNum to the new successor
					// the predecessor will halt until it sends all the pending updates to the successor
		args:	serverId, serverRelation

	- ack			// will receive the ack from the next server in the chain (successor)
					// delete all the req from the pendingReq list smaller than the seqNum received
					// send the ack to the predecessor
		args:	RequestContext


 Functions:
	- failure 			// If the server has exceeded its sent or receive count then it should terminate
						// It has to check whether the configuration is set to "unbound", under which it won't terminate
						// This function will do nothing but exit(0)

	- sync				// to send sync message to the next server in the chain (:successor)
		args: RequestContext

	- sendHeartBeat		// send the heart beat signal to the master
		args:	serverId
