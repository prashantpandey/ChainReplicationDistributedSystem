 General Data-Structures
 
 Map bankServerChain { bankId, List<Servers> }
 Map bankServer { bankId, head, tail }
 Map bankClients { bankId, clientId }
 List serverTS { serverId, timestamp }
 enum serverType { Head, Internal, Tail }
 enum serverRelation { successor, predecessor }

 Events: 
	- receive	
		- The server sends the liveness update. 
		- The master updates the serverTS list with its own current TS for the corresponding server. 
		- We assume that the master and server clocks are in sync (const drift).
		
	- extendChain	
		- The new server wants to be added in the chain for a bank.
		
 Functions:
	- notifyAll	
		- notify the client of the new head/tail, in case of head/tail failure.
	- notifyServer	
		- notify the server of the new successor/predecessor for internal failure.
		- also notify the respective servers if they are new head/tail, in case of head/tail failure.
	
	- checkFailure 	
		- probe the list of servers (every second), calculate the difference between the currentTS and the TS
		- of each server. If the difference is greater than 5 sec then its a server failure as no liveness
		- update was received by the master for that particular server in last 5 secs.
	
	- handleFailure	
		- Handles failure for head, tail and internal servers
