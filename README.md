In this course project we have implemented client-server model for
chain replication algorithm for high availability and fault-tolerence.
It is implemented in two different languages:
1. DistAlgo
2. NodeJs

Code Folders:-
1. distAlgo: chain_rep_distalgo
2. nodejs : chain_rep_node

Config Files:
1. config.json in respective folders
2. bootstrap.sh in nodejs consists of code to start clients and servers

Test cases:
1. payload.json: consists of manual data for testing the
	      client and server functionality

2. randomPayload.json: consists of data generated by giving probabilities
		    of bank operations (query, deposit and transfer) and
		    total no of requests for 6 clients.
		    Randomly generated test data sets for client and server
		    functionality

3. samePayload.json:  consists of same requests for query/withdraw/transfer
		   bank operations to verify that the same response is 
		   sent to client

4. inconsistentHistoryPayload.json: consists of requests to verify the inconsistent 
				with history scenario


Prerequisites:-
1. DistAlgo: You need to have the distribution <1.0.0.6b> installed on your system and added in the $PATH variable.
2. NodeJS: You need to have the distribution <0.10.32> installed on your system.
     Additional Modules:
	1. Winston: npm install winston
	2. Fibers: npm install fibers


Code Execution:-
1. distAlgo: python3 -m da -f chain_rep.da
2. nodejs: ./bootstrap.sh
